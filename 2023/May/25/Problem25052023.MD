**Q. ABC is a triangle, with incentre I. A line perpendicular to AT
from I meets BC at point M. The point D is on line AM such
that ID is perpendicular to AM. Prove that the points A, B,
C, and D are on the same circle.**



Let $E$ be pt of tangency of the incircle $ABC$, now notice $$ADEI$$ is cyclic
By $POP$ we get $MI^2=MD \times MA$
So we only have to proof $MI^2=MB \times MC$ such that $ABCD$ is cyclic
$MI^2=MB \times BC$ implies MI is also tangent to circumcircle of $IBC$,
but now using the incenter/excenter lemma us that circumcircle of $BIC$ lies on line $AI$, which means angle $MIG=180-\angle MIA=90$ and so $MI$ is tangent of circle
With $MB \times (MC)=MD \times (MA)$ $ABCD$ lies on a circle and we are done.
