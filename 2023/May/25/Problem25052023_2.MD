$Q$ $\Delta ABC$ is a triangle with incenter $I$. Show that the circumcenters of $\Delta IAB$, $\Delta IBC$, and $\Delta ICA$ lie on a circle whose center is the circumcenter of $\Delta ABC$. 

Let $M$ denote the midpoint of arc $AC$. It is well known that $M$ is equidistant from $A$, $C$, and $I$ (to check, prove $\angle IAM = \angle AIM = \frac{\angle BAC + \angle ABC}{2}$), so that $M$ is the circumcenter of $AIC$. Similar results hold for $BIC$ and $CIA$, and hence $O_c$, $O_a$, and $O_b$ all lie on the circumcircle of $ABC$.
