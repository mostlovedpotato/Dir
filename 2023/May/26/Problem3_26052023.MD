$Q.$ The bisector of angle at vertex $A$ of $\triangle ABC$ also bisects $\angle H_a AD$, where Ha is the foot of the altitude from $A$, $AD$ is a diameter of the circumcircle $(ABC)$.

$Sol.$ 
Let $F$ be the second intersection of the altitude AHa with $(ABC)$ and and $E$ the second intersection of the bisector. Let $M_a$ be the midpoint of $BC$.

Then $O, M_a, E$ are collinear. $\angle AEO=\angle EAO$ since $\triangle AEO$ is isosceles.
$\angle FAE=\angle AEO$ as alternate interior in parallel lines $AF$ and $EO$. It follows that $\angle FAE=\angle EAO$.
