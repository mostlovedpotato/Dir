$Q.$ Let ABC be a triangle. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ is tangent to $\overline{AB}$ at $\overline{AC}$ and D and E respectively. Let O denote the circumcenter of $\triangle BCI$. Prove that $\angle ODB = \angle OEC$.

$Sol.$ 
By the incenter-excenter lemma, A, I, O are collinear. Note that $AE = AD$, $AO=AO$, and $\angle EAO = \angle DAO$. Hence, by SAS, $\triangle AEO = \triangle ADO$. It follows that $\angle ODB = \angle OEC$.
