Assume in $\triangle PQR$, $\angle QPR=120^\circ$; $H, O, I, N$ are the orthocenter, circumcenter, incenter, and the center of the $9$-point circle, respectively. Then $PN \perp OH$ while $PI \parallel OH.$
In case $QPR=60^\circ$, $PN \perp OH$ still holds while $I$ lies on $PN.

$Sol.$ 
$OH$ is the Euler line of $\triangle PQR$ and, as such, contains $N$ midway between $O$ and $H$. Thus, $PN \perp OH$ is equivalent to $\triangle PHO$ being isosceles, in particular $PO=PH$. However, $PO=R$, the circumradius of $\triangle PQR$. Also, $$PH=2 \cdot R \cdot |cos(\angle QPR)|=R$$ implying that $PO=PH$, as needed.

Concerning $PI$, we know that the lines $PH$ and $PO$ are isogonal images of each other because $PI$ bisects one of the angles they form. This makes $PI$ either parallel or perpendicular to another bisector of one of the angles formed by $PH$ and $PO$. When $\angle QPR=120^\circ$, $PI$ and $PN$ are distinct and $PI \perp PN$. When $\angle QPR=60^\circ$, $PI$ and $PN$ coincide.
