**Mathematics is wonderful but she is Life for me**
**She used to be imaginary like life with full of iota's**
**But today, I felt the connection to the real numbers of life**
**She sat beside me as close as two twin primes with one gap in between**
**I felt her without looking at face of my life**
**But soon we parted ways, as the E-rickshaw stopped, my heartbeat was tending to zero**
**Heartfelt I sat there looking where she will go after that**
**I don't know her name but know there is connection to be felt**

**Today 27 May 2023 I realized something, and that is primes and those are intersting but all real numbers are significant**
